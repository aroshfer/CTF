# Hints ladder â€” Trusted Uploads

**Hint 1 (easy):**  
Client-side checks are cosmetic. The server enforces several checks.

**Hint 2 (medium):**  
There is an admin conversion flow that runs `cwebp` on a filename. Check how the server builds that shell command.

**Hint 3 (harder):**  
Uploaded files are re-encoded, but temporary files and filenames exist on disk briefly. Consider which values you can influence that later the admin flow uses.

**Hint 4 (final):**  
Think about how strings are interpolated into shell commands and what parts of the upload process end up as filenames or on-disk artifacts.

If you get stuck, try examining `server.js` and `public/admin.html`.
