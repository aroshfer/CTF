1) Open challenge.html
2) Use the search box and paste: <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
3) Submit â€” the reflected content will be injected into the page and the alert will fire.

Notes for maintainers:
- This intentionally vulnerable page demonstrates client-side reflection. To create a harder challenge, modify the page to filter common substrings and require an attribute-break payload or use Content Security Policy (CSP) to force non-script triggers.
