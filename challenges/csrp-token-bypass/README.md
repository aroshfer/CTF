README â€” how to run

Create a Python 3 virtualenv and install Flask: pip install flask.

Place app.py and the templates/ directory in the same folder.

Run python app.py and open http://localhost:5000.

Log in as alice, then open attacker.html from a different origin (or file://). Compute the token using the formula in the solution and submit the forged request.

Good luck! ðŸŽ¯
